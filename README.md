- ‚úÖ **Service alert notifications** (track maintenance, schedule changes)
- ‚úÖ **24-hour schedule caching** (efficient data usage)
- ‚úÖ **Updates every 30 seconds** for maximum accuracy

**Without the API key:** The app uses real Caltrain schedules from local GTFS files (no delays shown, schedule only)

### OpenWeatherMap API (for weather)

1. Register for a free API key at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Free tier: 1,000 calls/day, 60 calls/minute
2. Add to `.env.local` as `WEATHER_API_KEY`
3. The app automatically uses real weather data when the key is present

**What you get with WEATHER_API_KEY configured:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time weather for each Caltrain station (using GPS coordinates)
- ‚úÖ Temperature, conditions, wind speed, humidity
- ‚úÖ Updates every 10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to mock data if API fails

**Without the API key:** The app generates realistic mock weather data based on station latitude

### Ticketmaster API (for event crowding alerts)

**RECOMMENDED** - Instant approval, comprehensive coverage ‚≠ê

1. Register at [https://developer.ticketmaster.com/](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/)
2. Get your **Consumer Key** instantly after registration (no approval wait!)

**SeatGeek API** (requires approval)
- Register at [https://platform.seatgeek.com/](https://platform.seatgeek.com/)
- Wait for approval (can take a few days)
- Limited coverage

**Note:** See [app/api/events/route.ts](app/api/events/route.ts) for detailed implementation examples. Ticketmaster is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage with instant approval.

### Moscone Center Events (Fully Automatic) ‚ú®

**Important:** Many Moscone Center events (conventions, conferences) are NOT listed on Ticketmaster because they don't sell tickets publicly.

#### How It Works - Zero Maintenance Required!

The app **automatically fetches** Moscone events at runtime:

1. **Ticketmaster API** - Concerts, sports, public events (if API key configured)
2. **Moscone Events** - **Automatically fetched from SF Travel at runtime** (cached for 24 hours)
3. **Chase Center Events** - Manually maintained list (optional, for Warriors games)

#### Automatic Runtime Fetching

Moscone events are now **fetched automatically** every 24 hours:

‚úÖ **No scripts to run** - Events update automatically
‚úÖ **No manual maintenance** - App scrapes SF Travel convention calendar
‚úÖ **24-hour cache** - Minimizes requests, stays fresh
‚úÖ **Always up-to-date** - New events appear automatically
‚úÖ **Zero effort** - Just deploy and forget!

**How it works:**
- App fetches from https://portal.sftravel.com/calendar_public/home_sfdc.cfm
- Parses upcoming Moscone conventions (next 6 months)
- Caches results for 24 hours
- Automatically refreshes when cache expires
- Falls back to stale cache if fetch fails

#### Optional: Manual Script (Not Needed)

If you prefer to pre-generate events, you can optionally run:

```bash
# Optional - only if you want to pre-generate events
node scripts/update-moscone-events-auto.mjs
```

**But you don't need to!** The app handles everything automatically.

**Currently tracked events (automatically updated):**
- Dreamforce 2025 (Oct 14-16) - 170K attendees
- PyTorch Conference 2025 (Oct 21-23) - 30K attendees
- TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 (Oct 27-29) - 80K attendees
- Microsoft Ignite 2025 (Nov 17-21) - 150K attendees
- And ~15+ more events automatically

**Why this matters:** Major conventions can bring 100K+ attendees and cause severe crowding at 4th & King and 22nd Street stations during peak commute hours. The app automatically tracks these to help you plan your commute.

## GTFS Schedule Data

The app includes official Caltrain schedule data in the `/data/gtfs/` directory:

**Source**: [https://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/caltrain-ca-us/caltrain-ca-us.zip](https://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/caltrain-ca-us/caltrain-ca-us.zip)

**What's included**:
- ‚úÖ **Real train times** from Caltrain's official timetables
- ‚úÖ **Actual train numbers** (123, 125, 127, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Weekday/weekend/holiday schedules** automatically detected
- ‚úÖ **Schedule data for 29 Caltrain stations** (SF to Gilroy)
  - App allows selection of 23 active stations (SF to San Jose Diridon)
  - Inactive stations removed: Broadway, Atherton (Caltrain no longer stops)
  - South County stations excluded from UI as they're served by 8XX bus connector
- ‚úÖ **Works offline** - no API key required for basic schedules

**Updating the schedule**:
```bash
# Download latest GTFS data
curl -L -o /tmp/caltrain-gtfs.zip https://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/caltrain-ca-us/caltrain-ca-us.zip

# Extract to data directory
unzip -q /tmp/caltrain-gtfs.zip -d data/gtfs/
```

**Note**: GTFS data is typically updated when Caltrain changes their schedule (usually quarterly). The app automatically detects which schedule to use based on the current date.

## How Real-Time Features Work

### Train Delay Tracking

The app uses a **dual-source delay detection system** combining 511.org GTFS-Realtime with Caltrain.com alerts for maximum accuracy:

#### Layer 1: GTFS-Realtime (511.org)
1. **Trip Updates Feed**: Fetches real-time delay data every 30 seconds from 511.org
2. **Protocol Buffers**: Uses industry-standard GTFS-Realtime format for efficient data transfer
3. **Train-Specific Matching**: Each train's delay is matched by GTFS trip_id for accuracy
   - Ensures Train 421's delay is shown for Train 421 (not confused with other trains at the same station)
   - Checks maximum delay across all stops in the trip (captures delays that accumulate during the journey)
   - Matches delay information as reported by 511.org's official feed

#### Layer 2: Caltrain.com Alert Scraping (NEW!)
4. **Automated Web Scraping**: Uses Puppeteer to scrape https://www.caltrain.com/alerts in real-time
   - Parses official Caltrain PADS alerts (Passenger Alert and Display System)
   - Extracts train-specific delay information from alert text
   - Handles patterns like "Please Expect Up To 40-45 Minute Delay for Train 165"
5. **Smart Priority System**:
   - **Caltrain alerts override GTFS-RT** when GTFS-RT shows 0 delay but alerts indicate a delay
   - This solves cases where 511.org data is incomplete or stale
   - GTFS-RT still used for non-zero delays (both sources complement each other)
6. **Delay-Aware Filtering**:
   - Trains filter based on **actual departure time** (scheduled + delay), not just scheduled time
   - Delayed trains appear in schedules even if their scheduled departure has passed
   - Handles delays of any duration (including delays longer than 1 hour)

#### Display & Features
7. **Schedule Awareness**: Automatically handles different schedules:
   - **Weekday schedule**: More frequent trains during peak hours (6-9am, 4-7pm)
   - **Weekend schedule**: Reduced service on Saturdays and Sundays
   - **Holiday schedule**: Special service on major US holidays (New Year's, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas)
   - Real-time API automatically provides correct schedule based on current date
8. **Delay Detection**:
   - Compares scheduled vs. actual times at each stop
   - **Delay threshold**: Shows trains as "delayed" when 1 minute or more late
   - Uses the maximum delay across all stops to capture delays accumulated during the journey
9. **Visual Indicators**:
   - üü¢ Green badge = On time (0 minutes delay)
   - üü† Orange badge = Delayed (1+ minutes - shows exact delay)
   - üî¥ Red badge = Cancelled
10. **Service Alerts**: Displays system-wide disruptions and maintenance notices

### Weather Data

- Fetches current weather from **OpenWeatherMap API** using GPS coordinates for each station
- Updates every 10 minutes
- Displays temperature, conditions, wind speed, and humidity
- Converts metric to imperial units (Celsius ‚Üí Fahrenheit, m/s ‚Üí mph)

### Event Crowding Alerts

The app now features a **multi-source event detection system** that automatically fetches games and events from official sports APIs and venue sources:

#### Automated Sports Schedule Integration (NEW!)

**No API keys required** - all sports APIs are free and work out of the box:

1. **üèÄ NBA (Golden State Warriors)**
   - Source: ESPN NBA API
   - Venue: Chase Center, San Francisco
   - Affected Stations: 4th & King, 22nd Street
   - Auto-detects: Regular season, preseason, playoff games

2. **üèÄ WNBA (Golden State Valkyries)**
   - Source: ESPN WNBA API
   - Venue: Chase Center, San Francisco
   - Affected Stations: 4th & King, 22nd Street
   - Auto-detects: Regular season, preseason, playoff games

3. **‚öæ MLB (SF Giants)**
   - Source: MLB Stats API (official)
   - Venue: Oracle Park, San Francisco
   - Affected Stations: 4th & King, 22nd Street, Bayshore
   - Auto-detects: Regular season, spring training, playoff games

4. **üèà NFL (SF 49ers)**
   - Source: ESPN NFL API
   - Venue: Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara
   - Affected Stations: Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara
   - Note: Fans typically take Caltrain to Mountain View + VTA light rail
   - Auto-detects: Regular season, preseason, playoff games

5. **üèí NHL (San Jose Sharks)**
   - Source: NHL Web API (official)
   - Venue: SAP Center, San Jose
   - Affected Stations: San Jose Diridon (directly across the street!)
   - Auto-detects: Regular season, preseason, playoff games

#### Additional Event Sources

6. **üé§ Moscone Center Events** (Tech Conferences)
   - Source: SF Travel Convention Calendar (auto-scraped every 24h)
   - Major events: Dreamforce, Microsoft Ignite, TechCrunch Disrupt, PyTorch Conference
   - Affected Stations: 4th & King, 22nd Street

7. **üé´ Ticketmaster Events** (Concerts & Other Events)
   - Source: Ticketmaster Discovery API (requires API key)
   - 11+ SF Bay Area venues including Bill Graham, The Fillmore, The Masonic, Warfield
   - Geographic filtering ensures only SF Bay Area events

#### Smart Features

- **Pacific Time Zone Handling**: All games are correctly matched to their Pacific Time date
  - Date parameters are parsed as Pacific Time (not UTC midnight)
  - Game times are compared using Pacific Time dates
  - A 7pm PDT game shows up on the correct day, not shifted by UTC conversion
  - Ensures Warriors/Giants/49ers/Sharks/Valkyries games appear on the day fans expect
- **Intelligent crowd level detection** based on:
  - Venue capacity (Oracle Park, Chase Center, Levi's Stadium, SAP Center = high)
  - Event type (sports games, major concerts, tech conferences)
  - Ticket prices and popularity
- **Smart station mapping**: Shows which Caltrain stations are affected by each event
- **Automatic deduplication**: Combines data from multiple sources without showing duplicate events
- **Priority system**: Official sports APIs > Moscone events > Ticketmaster > Manual lists
- Updates every 30 minutes with 30-minute cache

### Train Schedule Architecture

The app uses a sophisticated two-layer approach for maximum accuracy:

**Layer 1: GTFS Static Schedule (Base Timetable)**
1. Fetches official Caltrain GTFS data from Trillium Transit CDN
2. Parses `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt` to determine active service (weekday/weekend/holiday)
3. Reads `trips.txt` and `stop_times.txt` for actual train times
4. Caches schedule data for 24 hours (refreshes daily)
5. Provides baseline schedule with correct train numbers and times

**Layer 2: GTFS-Realtime (Live Updates)**
1. Fetches live trip updates from 511.org every 30 seconds
2. **Matches delays by trip_id** to ensure each train gets its own accurate delay status
3. **Checks maximum delay** across all stops in each trip (not just the first stop)
4. Applies delays to scheduled trains based on exact trip matching
5. Updates train status (on-time, delayed, cancelled) per-train
   - Trains with 0 minutes delay ‚Üí "On time"
   - Trains with 1+ minutes delay ‚Üí "Delayed" (shows exact minutes)
   - Cancelled trains ‚Üí "Cancelled"
6. Combines with Layer 1 for complete picture

**Result**: Users see real Caltrain train numbers and schedule times, enhanced with train-specific live delay information from 511.org's official GTFS-Realtime feed.

**Note**: All real-time features gracefully fall back to intelligent mock data if API keys are not configured or if APIs fail. The app is fully functional without any API keys.
