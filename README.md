```

### Detailed Setup Instructions

### 511.org Transit API (for train schedules and delays)

1. Register for a free API key at [https://511.org/open-data/token](https://511.org/open-data/token)
2. Add to `.env.local` as `TRANSIT_API_KEY`
3. The app automatically uses real data when the key is present, including:
   - **GTFS Static Schedule**: Real Caltrain timetables (weekday/weekend/holiday schedules)
   - **GTFS-Realtime Trip Updates**: Real-time delay information for all trains
   - **Service Alerts**: Live service disruptions and notices

**What you get with TRANSIT_API_KEY configured:**
- ‚úÖ **Real Caltrain schedules** from official GTFS data
  - Actual train times based on Caltrain's published timetables
  - Automatic weekday, weekend, and holiday schedule detection
  - Correct train numbers and service patterns
- ‚úÖ **Real-time train delay tracking** (delays shown in minutes)
- ‚úÖ **On-time status indicators** (on-time, delayed, cancelled)
- ‚úÖ **Service alert notifications** (track maintenance, schedule changes)
- ‚úÖ **24-hour schedule caching** (efficient data usage)
- ‚úÖ **Updates every 30 seconds** for maximum accuracy

**Without the API key:** The app uses real Caltrain schedules from local GTFS files (no delays shown, schedule only)

### OpenWeatherMap API (for weather)

1. Register for a free API key at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api)
   - Free tier: 1,000 calls/day, 60 calls/minute
2. Add to `.env.local` as `WEATHER_API_KEY`
3. The app automatically uses real weather data when the key is present

**What you get with WEATHER_API_KEY configured:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time weather for each Caltrain station (using GPS coordinates)
- ‚úÖ Temperature, conditions, wind speed, humidity
- ‚úÖ Updates every 10 minutes
- ‚úÖ Automatic fallback to mock data if API fails

**Without the API key:** The app generates realistic mock weather data based on station latitude

### Ticketmaster API (for event crowding alerts)

**RECOMMENDED** - Instant approval, comprehensive coverage ‚≠ê

1. Register at [https://developer.ticketmaster.com/](https://developer.ticketmaster.com/)
2. Get your **Consumer Key** instantly after registration (no approval wait!)
3. Copy the **Consumer Key** (NOT the Consumer Secret) to `.env.local` as `TICKETMASTER_API_KEY`
4. Restart dev server

**What you get with TICKETMASTER_API_KEY configured:**
- ‚úÖ Real-time events from **9+ major SF venues**:
  - Oracle Park (SF Giants games)
  - Chase Center (Warriors games, major concerts)
  - Moscone Center (tech conferences: Dreamforce, WWDC, etc.)
  - Bill Graham Civic Auditorium (large concerts)
  - The Fillmore, The Masonic, Warfield Theatre (music venues)
  - August Hall, Regency Ballroom (concerts)
- ‚úÖ Automatic crowd level detection (high/moderate/low)
- ‚úÖ Smart affected station mapping
- ‚úÖ Updates every 30 minutes
- ‚úÖ Free tier: 5,000 API calls/day

**Without the API key:** No event crowding alerts are shown

### Alternative Event APIs (optional)

**MLB Stats API** (FREE - no key needed!)
- No registration required
- Perfect for SF Giants games at Oracle Park only
- Official MLB API: `https://statsapi.mlb.com`

**NBA API** (FREE - no key needed!)
- No registration required
- Perfect for Golden State Warriors games at Chase Center only
- Official NBA stats API

**SeatGeek API** (requires approval)
- Register at [https://platform.seatgeek.com/](https://platform.seatgeek.com/)
- Wait for approval (can take a few days)
- Limited coverage

**Note:** See [app/api/events/route.ts](app/api/events/route.ts) for detailed implementation examples. Ticketmaster is recommended as it provides the most comprehensive coverage with instant approval.

### Moscone Center Events (Automated Updates)

**Important:** Many Moscone Center events (conventions, conferences) are NOT listed on Ticketmaster because they don't sell tickets publicly. The app maintains a separate list for these high-impact events.

#### How It Works

The app checks TWO sources for events:
1. **Ticketmaster API** - Concerts, sports, public events
2. **Moscone Events List** - Major conventions & conferences (maintained with helper script)

#### Updating the Moscone Events List

Major conventions like **Dreamforce** (170K+ attendees) significantly impact Caltrain but aren't on Ticketmaster.

**Easy monthly update with helper script:**

```bash
# Run the update script once a month
node scripts/update-moscone-events.mjs

# The script will:
# 1. Show current events
# 2. Suggest upcoming events from SF Travel
# 3. Ask for confirmation
# 4. Update lib/moscone-events.ts automatically
```

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for detailed instructions.

**Manual method (if preferred):**

1. Check [https://portal.sftravel.com/calendar_public/home_sfdc.cfm](https://portal.sftravel.com/calendar_public/home_sfdc.cfm) for upcoming conventions
2. Edit [lib/moscone-events.ts](lib/moscone-events.ts)
3. Add event details to the `knownMosconeEvents` array:

```typescript
{
  name: 'Dreamforce 2025',
  startDate: '2025-10-14',
  endDate: '2025-10-16',
  description: 'Salesforce annual conference',
  estimatedAttendance: 170000,
  crowdLevel: 'high'
}
```

**Pre-configured events:**
- ‚úÖ Dreamforce 2025 (Oct 14-16, 2025)
- ‚úÖ PyTorch Conference 2025 (Oct 21-23)
- ‚úÖ TechCrunch Disrupt 2025 (Oct 27-29)
- ‚úÖ Microsoft Ignite 2025 (Nov 17-21)
- More added via monthly updates!

**Why this matters:** Major conventions can bring 100K+ attendees and cause severe crowding at 4th & King and 22nd Street stations during peak commute hours.

## GTFS Schedule Data

The app includes official Caltrain schedule data in the `/data/gtfs/` directory:

**Source**: [https://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/caltrain-ca-us/caltrain-ca-us.zip](https://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/caltrain-ca-us/caltrain-ca-us.zip)

**What's included**:
- ‚úÖ **Real train times** from Caltrain's official timetables
- ‚úÖ **Actual train numbers** (123, 125, 127, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **Weekday/weekend/holiday schedules** automatically detected
- ‚úÖ **Schedule data for 31 Caltrain stations** (SF to Gilroy)
  - App allows selection of 25 main stations (SF to San Jose Diridon)
  - South County stations excluded from UI as they're served by 8XX bus connector
- ‚úÖ **Works offline** - no API key required for basic schedules

**Updating the schedule**:
```bash
# Download latest GTFS data
curl -L -o /tmp/caltrain-gtfs.zip https://data.trilliumtransit.com/gtfs/caltrain-ca-us/caltrain-ca-us.zip

# Extract to data directory
unzip -q /tmp/caltrain-gtfs.zip -d data/gtfs/
```

**Note**: GTFS data is typically updated when Caltrain changes their schedule (usually quarterly). The app automatically detects which schedule to use based on the current date.

## How Real-Time Features Work

### Train Delay Tracking

The app integrates with **511.org's GTFS-Realtime API** to provide accurate train delay information:

1. **Trip Updates Feed**: Fetches real-time delay data every 30 seconds from 511.org
2. **Protocol Buffers**: Uses industry-standard GTFS-Realtime format for efficient data transfer
3. **Schedule Awareness**: Automatically handles different schedules:
   - **Weekday schedule**: More frequent trains during peak hours (6-9am, 4-7pm)
   - **Weekend schedule**: Reduced service on Saturdays and Sundays
   - **Holiday schedule**: Special service on major US holidays (New Year's, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, Christmas)
   - Real-time API automatically provides correct schedule based on current date
4. **Delay Detection**: Compares scheduled vs. actual times at each stop
5. **Visual Indicators**:
   - üü¢ Green badge = On time
   - üü† Orange badge = Delayed (shows delay in minutes)
   - üî¥ Red badge = Cancelled
6. **Service Alerts**: Displays system-wide disruptions and maintenance notices

### Weather Data

- Fetches current weather from **OpenWeatherMap API** using GPS coordinates for each station
- Updates every 10 minutes
- Displays temperature, conditions, wind speed, and humidity
- Converts metric to imperial units (Celsius ‚Üí Fahrenheit, m/s ‚Üí mph)

### Event Crowding Alerts

- Queries **Ticketmaster Discovery API** for events at 9+ SF venues
- Fetches events for the current day in parallel for all venues
- Intelligent crowd level detection based on:
  - Venue capacity (Oracle Park, Chase Center = high)
  - Event type (sports games, major concerts)
  - Ticket prices (expensive = high crowd)
  - Special conventions (Dreamforce, WWDC at Moscone)
- Updates every 30 minutes

### Train Schedule Architecture

The app uses a sophisticated two-layer approach for maximum accuracy:

**Layer 1: GTFS Static Schedule (Base Timetable)**
1. Fetches official Caltrain GTFS data from Trillium Transit CDN
2. Parses `calendar.txt` and `calendar_dates.txt` to determine active service (weekday/weekend/holiday)
3. Reads `trips.txt` and `stop_times.txt` for actual train times
4. Caches schedule data for 24 hours (refreshes daily)
5. Provides baseline schedule with correct train numbers and times

**Layer 2: GTFS-Realtime (Live Updates)**
1. Fetches live trip updates from 511.org every 30 seconds
2. Applies delays to scheduled trains
3. Updates train status (on-time, delayed, cancelled)
4. Combines with Layer 1 for complete picture

**Result**: Users see real Caltrain train numbers and schedule times, enhanced with live delay information.

### Data Flow Architecture

```
User Request ‚Üí Next.js API Route ‚Üí GTFS Static + GTFS-Realtime APIs ‚Üí Data Processing ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí User Response
                                          ‚Üì
                            Trillium Transit (schedules, 24h cache)
                                          +
                                 511.org (delays, 30s cache)
```

**Note**: All real-time features gracefully fall back to intelligent mock data if API keys are not configured or if APIs fail. The app is fully functional without any API keys.
